        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          As a passionate and experienced software engineer, I specialize in
          leveraging Kubernetes to streamline and optimize deployment processes.
          With a strong background in observability and automation, I excel at
          creating robust, scalable systems that enhance operational efficiency
          and reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expertise lies in designing and implementing solutions that provide
          deep insights into system performance and facilitate proactive
          troubleshooting. By harnessing the power of automation, I ensure
          seamless integration and continuous improvement of development
          workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am seeking a challenging platform engineering role where
          I can contribute my skills and experience to drive innovation and
          excellence. Let's connect if you're looking for someone who is
